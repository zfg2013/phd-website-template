The summary sections below provide an overview of the PhD defense (i.e., date & etiquette), my research, and selected awards. Page sections listed above provide further detail. See you all in November.

### PhD Summary

The PhD defense is a cumulative presentation of scientific philosophy for a particular expertise acquired by the student. The student will defend their philosophy by conveying their accumulated evidence to the audience and examiners. In my case, my current philosophy is that artificial intelligence (AI)-driven experimentation accelerates precision medicine development.

To demonstrate this philosophy, I have demonstrated 4 different approaches to harness extracellular vesicle signaling into diagnostic tests for pancreatic and bladder cancers, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and a melanoma immunotherapeutic.
